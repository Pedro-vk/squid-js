## Get started

Start by adding the package to your dependencies:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/squid --save
```

The package exposes `Ocean` and `Logger` which you can import in your code like this:

```js
// ES6
import { Ocean, Logger } from '@oceanprotocol/squid'

// ES2015
const { Ocean, Logger } = require('@oceanprotocol/squid')
```

You can then connect to a running [Keeper](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) & [Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius) instance, e.g.:

```js
const ocean: Ocean = await Ocean.getInstance({
    // the node of the blockchain to connect to, could also be infura
    nodeUri: "http://localhost:8545",
    // the uri of aquarius
    aquariusUri: "http://localhost:5000",
    // the uri of brizo
    brizoUri: "http://localhost:8030",
    // address that brizo uses
    brizoAddress: "0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e"
    // the uri to the parity node you want to use for encryption and decryption
    parityUri: "http://localhost:9545",
    // the uri of the secret store that holds the keys
    secretStoreUri: "http://localhost:12001"
})
```

### Examples

You can see how `squid-js` is used on:

* [Integration test](/src/integration/ocean/)
* [Tuna](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tuna/tree/develop/node)

## Documentation

**[Docs: squid-js API Reference ‚Üí](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/squid-js/)**

Alternatively, you can generate the raw TypeDoc documentation locally by running:

```bash
# will output to ./doc folder
npm run doc
```

## Development

To start development you need to:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

For unit tests, running [`ganache-cli`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) is required before starting the tests:

```bash
npm i -g ganache-cli
ganache-cli
```

To start unit tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

or to watch for changes:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

to create code coverage information:

```bash
npm run test:cover
```

### Integration Tests

Besides a running `ganache-cli` instance, a locally running Ocean network is required. To do so before running the tests, use [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

./start_ocean.sh --latest --no-pleuston --local-spree-node
```

In another terminal window, run this script and export the seed phrase:

```bash
# copies the contract artifacts once the local Ocean network is up and running
./scripts/wait_for_migration_and_extract_keeper_artifacts.sh

# export Spree accounts seed phrase
export SEED_WORDS="taxi music thumb unique chat sand crew more leg another off lamp"
```

Once everything is up, run the integration tests:

```bash
npm run integration
```

to generate code coverage information during test, run:

```bash
npm run integration:cover
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
./bumpversion path
```

git tag with the latest version and `git push`
